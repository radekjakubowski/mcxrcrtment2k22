Assignment for Angular Developer role at Macrix Technology Group hosted at https://adorable-lollipop-a3a882.netlify.app/

Implement a web application which displays a table of people containing the following information:

First Name,
Last Name
Street Name
House Number
Apartment Number (optional)
Postal Code
Town
Phone Number
Date of Birth
Age (read-only)

The application should allow a user to edit the data inline, add new users and delete existing ones. Below the table there should be two buttons: "Save" and "Cancel". When the Save button is pressed, changes made by the user should be sent to the server. Pressing the "Cancel" button discards user changes and causes the table to be refreshed based on the data fetched from the server. The buttons should be active only if the table contains unsaved data.

The server can use memory as storage (after restaring server, data can disappear).

When you don't have experience with implementation of server, you can mock it on frontend side.

Please provide us with the source code of the application that conforms to the specification above.
